## Usage

WORK IN PROGRESS

## Development

### Prerequisites

You'll need to install

- Node.js, matching the version specified in our [.node-version](../.node-version) file

  - A version manager that supports this file is recommended, for example [n](https://github.com/tj/n#readme).
    Note that [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) [does not](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/issues/794).

- pnpm, matching the version specified in our [package.json](./package.json) file

  - After installing Node.js, you can enable [Corepack](https://nodejs.org/api/corepack.html) to transparently install the correct `pnpm` version:
    ```console
    $ corepack enable
    ```

### Build

```
pnpm run build
```
